## Concepts

*Concepts about Autonomous World*

- [Autonomous Worlds by ludens](https://0xparc.org/blog/autonomous-worlds) - A Must-read Blog
    - This essay introduced the concept of Autonomous Worlds. 
    > Autonomous Worlds are *interobjective* realities. 
    > A World is a container for entities and a coherent-enough internal ruleset about how they behave1. When a system of entities and rules comes to life, it becomes a World.
